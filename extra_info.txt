The class comes with the method validate_positive_integers(list) where the a list is parsed as an argument.
The method returns a list consisting of only the positive integers whether they were contained in strings or not.
All items will be converted to type integer.
After validation, the method will print a success message to console.

To use, simply create an instance of UserInputValidator and call validate_positive_integers() with the list you wish to validate.
